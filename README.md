# Self study Machine Learning

Self studying machine learning with Python.
The textbook I am using is Building Machine Learning Systems with Python by Richert Coelho.

## Chapter 1:

Prediction using regression (using sklearn's polyfit)

Dataset: web traffic

## Chapter 2:

Supervised classification with threshold and k nearest neighbors (self-implemented)

Data set: sklearn's iris dataset and the seeds dataset

## Chapter 3:

Clustering with algorithms such as k-means clustering and spectral clustering (self-implemented) 

Data set: sklearn's randomly generated toy datasets

## Chapter 4:

Topic modeling using Latent Dirichle Allocation (using gensim and mallet model)

Dataset: collected political articles
